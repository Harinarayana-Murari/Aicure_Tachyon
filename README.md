# aicure_Tachyon

This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting heart rates based on physiological features. The model utilizes the Gradient Boosting Regressor algorithm and is implemented in the `run.py` script.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- Python 3
- pandas
- scikit-learn == 1.3.0
- joblib

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Bhargavmupparisetty/aicure_Tachyon.git
   cd aicure_Tachyon

### Files:

- **run.py:** Python script for executing the heart rate prediction.
- **gradient_boosting_model.joblib:** Pre-trained machine learning model for heart rate prediction.
- **README.md:** Documentation for the repository.
- **AICURE_PARSEC_TACHYON:** jupyter notebook containing the model preparation.
- **LICENSE.md:** License information for the project.
-  **Report.pdf:** contains the Report on the process of making the model.
   
### Running the Model
1.Prepare Test Data:
Ensure you have a CSV file containing test data.For example, `test_data.csv`.

2.Run the Prediction:
 
`python run.py test_data.csv`

In the command replace the `test_data.csv` with your csv file address.

3.View Results:

The predicted heart rates will be saved to `results.csv`.

### Additional Notes
The provided model is a basic example. Feel free to explore and modify the model hyperparameters and features based on your specific requirements.
Ensure that the input data format matches the training data for accurate predictions.
